# RedBlackTrees
/*
This project demonstrates the use of red black trees without using STLs. A set of nodes and booleans check the rules of the red black trees after every addition to it. The top 50 imbd movies as a txt file are inserted via command line and organized accordingly. 

The user also has the ability to delete movies which causes more balancing functionality.
